# Python Fundamentals & APIs

## Topics Covered
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- Control Flow (if, elif, else, loops)
- Logical Operators (and, or, not)
- Randomization (random module)
- Python Lists (operations and methods)

## What I Practiced
- Writing conditional statements
- Using loops for repetition
- Applying logical operators in decision making
- Generating random values
- Working with lists (append, remove, index, slicing)

## Notes
- APIs allow applications to communicate with each other
